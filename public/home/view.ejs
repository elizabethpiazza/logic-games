    <div>
        You're working.
            <br><b>HARD.</b>
            <br>To improve at the Logic Games section of the LSAT.
            <br>But is it working for you?
    </div>
    <div class="text-left">
        <p>Are you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improving your accuracy?</li>
                <li>Getting fast enough?</li>
                <li>Tracking your overall logic games progress?</li>
                <li><b>Going to get that 180?!?</b></li>
            </ul>
        <p>Maybe you are paying attention to these things. Hell, if you are neurotic enough to take the LSAT you probably have a 15 sheet+ spreadsheet detailing all of these metrics.</p>
        <p><b>Game Gainz</b> is here so you don't have to worry about that kind of thing. Focus on the studying. Focus on the test. Let us take care of the grunt work, and <b>focus</b> on what matters.</p>
